            <!-- 中文段落 -->
            <p id="feature4Text">经过一年的学习生活，我发现我们在日常学习和校园生活中存在一些痛点。比如，同学们在学习过程中，经常会遇到无法及时找到有用信息的困境。许多学习资料、优质的资源以及与校园生活相关的实用信息（如老师的办公室位置等）往往难以通过简单的搜索获取。尤其是对于刚入学的新生来说，他们对校内资源和获取渠道的了解有限，这种问题更加突出。</p>
            <p id="feature4AdditionalText">尽管网络上存在不少优质的学习解决方案，如各类学习网站、资源分享平台，甚至社交媒体上的推荐，但个人精力毕竟有限，要在海量信息中找到真正有价值的内容往往需要耗费大量时间和精力。此外，一些优质资源还可能因技术门槛较高，导致学生无法顺利获取和利用。</p>
            <p id="feature4FinalText">为了解决这些问题，我创立了 WFLAer.space 项目。该项目旨在整合各类资源，为世外国际部的师生提供学习和校园生活的支持与帮助。我们团队积极探索创新，不仅推出了许多特色内容，还密切关注教育前沿的科技发展。比如，国际学校的教育环境非常鼓励学生探索新兴技术，甚至在课堂中引入AI。在去年，我们创立了一个面向学校师生的 AIGC 服务平台，经过近一年的探索与实践，该平台获得了首批用户的好评。基于此成功经验，我们有信心为师生提供一个低成本、功能全面的 AIGC 平台，并将其并入 WFLAer.space 项目。敬请期待我们的进一步发展和创新！</p>

            <p id="feature4TextEn" style="display: none;">After a year of studying and living, I have noticed some pain points in our daily learning and campus life. For instance, students often encounter difficulties in finding useful information promptly during their studies. Many learning materials, high-quality resources, and practical information related to campus life (such as teachers' office locations) are often hard to obtain through simple searches. This problem is especially pronounced for new students who have limited knowledge of campus resources and access channels.</p>
            <p id="feature4AdditionalTextEn" style="display: none;">Despite the abundance of quality learning solutions available online, such as various educational websites, resource-sharing platforms, and even recommendations on social media, individual efforts are limited. Navigating through vast amounts of information to find truly valuable content often requires significant time and energy. Additionally, some premium resources may have high technical barriers, preventing students from accessing and utilizing them effectively.</p>
            <p id="feature4FinalTextEn" style="display: none;">To address these issues, I founded the WFLAer.space project. This initiative aims to integrate various resources to provide support and assistance for the learning and campus life of students and teachers at WFLA International. Our team is committed to exploring innovation, not only launching many unique contents but also closely following the forefront of educational technology developments. For example, the educational environment in international schools highly encourages students to explore emerging technologies, even incorporating AI into classrooms. Last year, we established an AIGC service platform for school staff and students. After nearly a year of exploration and practice, the platform received positive feedback from its initial users. Building on this successful experience, we are confident in providing a low-cost, comprehensive AIGC platform for teachers and students, integrating it into the WFLAer.space project. Stay tuned for our further development and innovation!</p>
